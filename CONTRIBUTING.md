- Propose a new feature by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-mobile-components/issues/new/choose)
- Avoid issues labeled [unconfirmed](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-mobile-components/labels/unconfirmed) or [tb-team](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-mobile-components/labels/tb-team) as they are not yet ready for contributions.

**2. Discuss your plan:**

**4. Create a branch:**

**5. Make your changes:**

- Write your code and commit it to your branch.

**6. Test your changes:**

- Run the project's tests to make sure everything works and that your changes don't introduce any regressions.
- If applicable, write new tests to cover your changes.

**7. Push your changes:**

- Upload your branch to your forked repository.

**8. Open a pull request:**

- Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main project.
